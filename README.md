# Automatic Water Filling System - Using NodeMCU

The Automatic Water Tank System is a technological solution designed to manage water storage and consumption. It consists of a combination of hardware and software components, this system is made to enhance efficiency, convenience, and sustainability in water usage.

   1. Hardware Components: 
-	Water Tank
-	Well
-	Ultrasonic Sensor
-	Water Taps and Pipes
-	Water pump / Motor

   2. Software Components
The software components of the system encompass control algorithms and user interfaces.

Control Algorithms - The control algorithm is programmed in the Node MCU and the blynk software. This considers real-time sensor data to make decisions about when and how much water to fill or release. Also, manual overriding option is available through blynk app.

User Interfaces - A user friendly Interface is made by the use of the Blynk App
